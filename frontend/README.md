## Project Structure
The Flutter app project follows the Flutter recommended project structure, which organizes code into various directories for better maintainability and scalability. Here's an overview of the main directories:
- **lib/screens**: Contains screen-level widgets representing different sections of the app (e.g., HomeScreen, JobsScreen, TasksScreen).
- **lib/widgets**: Houses reusable UI widgets used across the app.
- **lib/providers**: Manages application state using Provider or Bloc pattern, including state management logic and data models.
- **lib/services**: Contains service classes for handling API requests, authentication, and other backend-related functionalities.
- **lib/utils**: Houses utility functions and helper classes used across the project.
